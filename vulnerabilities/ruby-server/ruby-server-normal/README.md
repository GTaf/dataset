Run 'vagrant up' to simulate the normal behavior of a ruby server and to get its provenance data

After the command 'vagrant up', you will be able to find the provenance data in '/tmp/audit.log'. You can copy this log file from the VM to your local machine by 'cp /tmp/audit.log /vagrant/'. Now its copy should appear in the same folder as where this README.md and the Vagrantfile locate on your local machine.
