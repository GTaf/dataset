# "Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for 
# supporting access control security policies." "SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space 
# tools that have been added to various Linux distributions."
# "The security of an "unmodified" Linux system (a system without SELinux) depends on the correctness of the kernel, 
# of all the privileged applications, and of each of their configurations. A problem in any one of these areas may 
# allow the compromise of the entire system. In contrast, the security of a "modified" system (based on an SELinux kernel) 
# depends primarily on the correctness of the kernel and its security-policy configuration. While problems with the
# correctness or configuration of applications may allow the limited compromise of individual user programs and system 
# daemons, they do not necessarily pose a threat to the security of other user programs and system daemons or to the 
# security of the system as a whole."
# Based on what's discussed above, and article below, we can say that selinux has been acting as a security patch to the 
# linux kernel. Some may argue that disabling selinux means that we are intentionally making the system vulnerable. However, 
# we need to keep in mind that there are circumstances under which people set selinux to be permissive or modify its 
# configuration to loose its very strict policies so that some applications would run properly. Therefore, setting selinux 
# here does not have a negative influence on this exploit, as it's truly an exploit that can only be corrrectly resolved by 
# the application vendor itself, not by selinux whose goals are protecting the system at a broader level and adding
# an additional layer of security checks.
