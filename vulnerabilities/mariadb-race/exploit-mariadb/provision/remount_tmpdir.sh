# Remounting the /tmp directory to allow users to run programs with suid bit set. 
# With the fresh install of the current dennisli1/frapbox, users would see the /tmp
# directory mounted as nosuid. This would prohibit any program within the directory 
# run with suid behavior, even when its suid bit is set. However, a lot of the 
# fresh out of box systems do not have this /tmp mounted as nosuid, so attackers
# can easily exploit this attribute. 

# Once this bit is set, you can run the programs in `\tmp` folder as the owner of the program
# That means, you have the owner's privileges.
